# Semantic search algorithm for job description queries

In this repo, I build a semantic search algorithm using a transformer model from Sentence Transformers, to queriy a vector data base of job descriptions I built using Chroma DB.


The tasks outlined here demonstrate my knowlege of SQL, sqlite, Vector Databases, Transformer based models, data modelling, and data science concepts.

These challenges were were originally posed as part of a project based interview for a Data and AI internship at Cisive.
