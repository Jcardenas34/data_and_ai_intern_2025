    "In this notebook, I build a semantic search algorithm to search for jobs within a descriptions database, that are most closely match the user search criteria. Here, I use the \"descriptions\" data column of job_postings.csv using the sqlite job_postings.db database created in the sql_schema.ipynb. The search algorithm is based on the \"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\" model from the `sentence_transformers` library and embeds each descriptions paragraph with a 384 dimentional vector. The model embeds 7066 samples  of descriptions using the `extract_text_and_jobid` function. The top 10 most semantically similar results are displayed within their respective sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance assestment\n",
    "The model performance was evaluated on all 7066 job descriptions within the job_postings.csv that it was trained on,\n",
    "No testing set was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following 3 queries were used to test the model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I'm looking for a job that requires a nursing degree\n",
    "2. Construction work, civil engineering, architecture\n",
    "3. Are there any medical research jobs?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to asess the performance of the algorithm I simply scanned the results dataset of each query to see how well the algorithm was able to return a relevant result. Often times the model was able to output a result that was relevant to the query, but not in all cases. For example when using the \"Construction work, civil engineering, architecture\" query, its rank 3 suggestion was much too high for the desciption paragraph to warrant \n",
    "\n",
    "`Rank 3:  ['Skills:Category plan development and management large dollar risk purchasesSupplier development and performanceNegotiations and competitive processContract development, management, and administration (may include Construction Specifications Institute)Spend and market analysisPlanning and forecastingContinuous improvement and productivityRelationship Management'] `\n",
    "\n",
    "Very little is said about Construction work, civil engineering or architecture.. it is possible that this paragraph recived such a high ranking because of the explicit word \"construction\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More rigorously, one could treat this as a classification task and use a ROC curve to evaluate performance. Step 1 would be to label all descriptions with classification tag, giving us a true positive dataset for each class. We could maybe use the 'industry' characteristic in the company_industries.csv as a truth label, and create a standardized question ask the agent, ex. \"Retreive any postings related to the \"X\" industry\", and evaluate TPR and FPR metrics to asess model performance. As well as evaluate the model on a labeled testing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "One might, less rigorously be able to count number of times key words from the search string appear in the job descriptions and create a similarity matrix of our own to assess performance. The key phrases in the queries above count be, \"nursing degree' \"Construction\", 'civil engineering\", \"architecture\", and \"medical research\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods to improve algorithm\n",
    "1. Perhaps using a more sophisticated LLM model architecture such as Ollama3 or ChatGPT-4o would provide more powerful sematinic matching. This would allow for the words within the search phrase itsself to inform the model of the true meaning of any homonyms used.\n",
    "2. Cleaning of the description data might also help model performance, as can be seen below, the description paragraphs contained hidden \"\\n\", \"\\n\\n\", ,\"\\u202\", etc. characters that could be preventing the model from identifying key words properly. I notice that the description paragraphs still contain spacing typos such as 'weekSalary'  which the model might interpret as 1 word, potentially affecting model performance.\n",
